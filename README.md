A raycast script command that will detect images in your markdown file, upload those images to S3, and replace the image links in the markdown file with links to S3. This was built for our use case of writing blog posts in Notion, downloading the blog posts as markdown, and converting the markdown to something we can use in Framer by having all the images hosted on S3.

This has only been tested with markdown exported from Notion.
